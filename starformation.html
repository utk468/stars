<p>The formation of a star begins with gravitational instability within a molecular cloud, caused by regions of higher
    densityâ€”often triggered by compression of clouds by radiation from massive stars, expanding bubbles in the
    interstellar
    medium, the collision of different molecular clouds, or the collision of galaxies (as in a starburst
    galaxy).[65][66]
    When a region reaches a sufficient density of matter to satisfy the criteria for Jeans instability, it begins to
    collapse under its own gravitational force.[67</p>

<p>
    s the cloud collapses, individual conglomerations of dense dust and gas form "Bok globules". As a globule collapses
    and the density increases, the gravitational energy converts into heat and the temperature rises. When the
    protostellar cloud has approximately reached the stable condition of hydrostatic equilibrium, a protostar forms at
    the core.[68] These pre-main-sequence stars are often surrounded by a protoplanetary disk and powered mainly by the
    conversion of gravitational energy. The period of gravitational contraction lasts about 10 million years for a star
    like the sun, up to 100 million years for a red dwarf.[
