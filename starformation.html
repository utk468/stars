<p>The formation of a star begins with gravitational instability within a molecular cloud, caused by regions of higher
densityâ€”often triggered by compression of clouds by radiation from massive stars, expanding bubbles in the interstellar
medium, the collision of different molecular clouds, or the collision of galaxies (as in a starburst galaxy).[65][66]
When a region reaches a sufficient density of matter to satisfy the criteria for Jeans instability, it begins to
collapse under its own gravitational force.[67</p>
