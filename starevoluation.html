<p>Stars condense from regions of space of higher matter density, yet those regions are less dense than within a vacuum
chamber. These regions—known as molecular clouds—consist mostly of hydrogen, with about 23 to 28 percent helium and a
few percent heavier elements. One example of such a star-forming region is the Orion Nebula.[56] Most stars form in
groups of dozens to hundreds of thousands of stars.[57] Massive stars in these groups may powerfully illuminate those
clouds, ionizing the hydrogen, and creating H II regions. Such feedback effects, from star formation, may ultimately
disrupt the cloud and prevent further star formation.[58]</p>
